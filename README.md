# Hydrogen Tank Valve Controller – IIT Ropar BTP Project

This repository contains simulation models, controller code, and supporting documentation for the development of an **On-Tank Valve (OTV) Control System** for hydrogen-fueled vehicles (HFCEVs), based on **SAE J2601 fueling protocols**.

## 🧪 Project Overview

- Simulated Pressure Ramp Rate (PRR) and fueling behavior using SAE J2601 methods (Lookup Table & MC Formula).
- Designed an **ESP32-based control system** for solenoid actuation during hydrogen fueling.
- Reverse-engineered commercial hydrogen tank valves to identify wiring, components, and safety features.
- Built a working simulation with >80% agreement between theoretical and practical PRR behavior.
